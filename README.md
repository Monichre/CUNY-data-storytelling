CUNY J(ournalism) Data
=========

It took me a few semesters to nail down my filing system, so there's a fair amount of detritus in this repository. But ... almost all of my teaching materials for my Data Driven Storytelling course at CUNY Graduate School of Journalism are nestled in here somewhere. 

If you found your way here because someone told you that I publish all my course material and it is super useful, you should probably check out my [Data Skills](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-skills/) class. 

The `gh-pages` branch fuels the [public facing site](http://amandabee.github.io/CUNY-data-skills/) and my own weekly course plans live on the `master` branch of the [repository](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-skills/).

Data Skills is a required first semester course in the Social Journalism Masters program. Data Driven Storytelling is a second or third semester elective in the MA in Journalism program.
