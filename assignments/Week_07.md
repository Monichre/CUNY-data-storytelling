Migrate your first storyboard or a super-duper-rough draft of your first story into a Bootstrap Page. 

Somewhere on there, add a jQuery stepper or other UI piece. 

## Redesign

Working alone (not in teams), re-design *one* of the three infographics below. Identify weaknesses in visualization and/or design weaknesses and explain how you would improve them. Sketch your ideas out! Deliverable: sketch on paper, scanned to be submitted and for potential presentation. If you do this assignment on scratch paper, you need to scan or photograph it. Email your re-designs with the subject line “Homework Week 7”    (Thanks to Jeff Heer of Stanford for design examples)
