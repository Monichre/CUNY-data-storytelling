# Homework Week 7: (Due Mar 20)

I want everyone to create one page in a basic bootstrap template, but I only need to see one storyboard from each team. <!--more-->

## Upcoming Deadlines
Some reminders from the syllabus:

+ **Mar 21** Storyboard 2
+ **Mar 28** Rough Draft 1
+ **Apr 04** Final Story 1
+ **Apr 25** Rough Draft 2
+ **May 02** Final Story 2
+ **May 09** Revisions Story 1
+ **May 16** Revisions Story 2


## Storyboard 2
You're going to put your storyboard in a Bootstrap template, upload it to digital storage and email me the URL. 

With your partner, take another pass at your second pitch: refine your "main elements" into clear statements about what a reader should take away from this story. Start making phone calls and organizing the questions you still have to answer to write the story. 

I want you to play with putting something in a set of tabs: names of possible sources, main elements, paragraphs. It doesn't have to make perfect sense, I just want you to experiment. 

### Links and Images
We didn't talk about adding images to an HTML page, or about adding links. If either is too complicated, let me know. Or add a note to your HTML page with the URL of a blog post where you did manage to get the images up. 

The basic HTML syntax is this: 

- `<img src="/path/to/image" alt="description in words" />`
- `<a href="http://example.com/url/for/link">Visible Text</a>`

If that's already overwhelming, don't panic. We'll spend more time on this in class if we need to. 

## Help!
I wrote up a [walk through of SimpleHTTPServer](http://hickman.spring-2014.dataviz.journalism.cuny.edu/2014/03/16/bootstrap-and-simplehttp/) on the class blog and posted [my bootstrap templates](https://github.com/amandabee/cunyjdata/tree/master/lecture%20notes/bootstrap) online.  And I'll add some more basic HTML tips shortly. 

## Bootstrap
If your partner took the lead on laying out the HTML for your storyboard, I want you to make a bootstrap-based page of your own. You can do any of the following:

- Layout a super rough draft of Story 1
- Take a story you're working on for another class and put it into a Bootstrap template
- Write a few paragraphs about what you're hoping we'll get to focus on before the semester is out (and why) and put those in a bootstrap template.
