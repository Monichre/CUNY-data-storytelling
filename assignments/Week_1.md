# Homework Week 1 (Due Feb 7)

Since we got a late start and you don't have a full week, I spread out the homework some. 

## Send to me by 5 PM on Thursday:
URLs for three data sets that interest you. Use the subject "Homework
Week 1" and I'll definitely see it.

## By 9:30 AM Friday
Install [Tabula](http://tabula.nerdpower.org/) If you get an error like "Tableau is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash," [the solution](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/590) to is not at all intuitive: You have to Change your Privacy and Security settings to allow applications downloaded from "Anywhere" -- it's on the "general" tab. 



Read Cairo: The Functional Art, Reading part 1: pages 25-31, 36-44, on thinking through a visualization as a tool for the reader; what graphical form best serves the goal? On e-reserve (access details on the syllabus)

Skim <http://perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf> and <http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/infokits/data-visualisation/type-of-charts/>


## Due 5 PM Monday:
Write a short blog post that describes the provenance of each of your three data sets data (who maintains it?), where the data can be found (include a link) and in less than 200 words each, explain why the data is interesting.
