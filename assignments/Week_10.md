# Homework Week 10 (Due Nov 13)

Week 11 we’ve got CartoDB coming in, so you need to go through two CartoDB tutorials to get ready. Your fist pitches are also due.

## CartoDB
* [Conditional Styling](http://developers.cartodb.com/tutorials/visualizing_relationships.html)
* [Relationships](http://developers.cartodb.com/tutorials/visualizing_relationships.html)

Don't just cut and paste commands, though: retype them. Really. You'll learn faster.

If you’re really overwhelmed, let me know. This should take you an hour or two but it shouldn’t make you totally crazy. If you’re really hitting walls we can do this together in class next week, but it should be straightforward.


## Team Projects: Pitches Due

A complete pitch should tell us who cares, why we care now, and what pre-reporting you’ve done. You must include...
+ a question or thesis
+ a news hook, or explanation of why this story matters now
+ a description of and link to the data (which means you have to find your data!)
+ one source you have already spoken with or at least three potential expert sources and your plans for reaching them
