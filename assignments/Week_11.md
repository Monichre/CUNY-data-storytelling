# Homework Week 11 (Due Nov 20)
For Nov 20, you’re going to make a timeline, try your hand at finishing our regular expression project and work with your partner to revise your pitches and add storyboards to them. A guest speaker TBD will join us and talk a little bit about his/her work, so take a few minutes to check his work out.

## Timelines
Make and embed one timeline using either Timeline.JS or WNYC’s Vertical Timeline. You may use an alternative tool (say, some fancy jQuery) but only with prior approval. So let us know if there is something fancier you'd like to play with. 

You can repurpose reporting from another story, but we do want to see clean content that is displayed logically and makes sense in the format you’ve chosen.

Tag it "Timeline"

## Regex Followup
See the regex instructions and finish using regular expressions to transform bad data into good. If you don’t succeed, that’s fine. But at least try.

## Team Projects: Storyboards Due
Revise your pitches and submit them with story boards. From the syllabus:

> *Storyboards: A storyboard organizes your content conceptually and spatially. This semester, when you turn in storyboards, you should also include a revised pitch. We use wireframe and storyboards interchangeably here. We’re looking for a simple sketch (on paper, in Word, or PowerPoint, Illustrator, or any number of online storyboarding tools) that shows us how you intend to integrate your visualizations, words, and navigation elements. Use simple boxes to tell us where your different elements will be positioned in a design, and how a user will navigate through the content.*
