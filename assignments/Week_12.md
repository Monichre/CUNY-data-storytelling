# Homework Week 12: Due Dec 04

## Team: Story 2 Rough Draft  
Rough Drafts are due in class next week. This draft represents 25% of your grade on this story.

> Rough Drafts: A rough draft does not have to have the polish of a final project, but it should be close. You should have created the visualizations that you plan to use. Your classmates should be able to evaluate a rough draft on its merits, without a guided tour of forthcoming features. A complete rough draft includes:  
> + Clean data in spreadsheets, already normalized, sorted, manipulated  
> + Visualizations of the data with labeled axes  
> + Captions  
> + Credits  
> + A headline  
> + At least three links to other reporting that puts your story in a broader context  
> + Introductory text (50 to 100 words) that includes information gleaned from at least one human source    
> + A source list, exactly like the ones you hand in for Craft II  

> Youâ€™re not required to quote your source, but you do need to be able to tell the class what insights your human source provided.

Rough drafts should be posted to the class blog; Source lists should be emailed with the subject "Story 1 Source List: LastName/LastName" (but use your teams' names, not ours!)
