# Homework Week 2 (Due Sep 18)

You have two assignments: we want you to answer a handful of specific questions using [data that Slate published][1] alongside [How Many People Have Been Killed by Guns Since Newtown?][2] and we want you to download the CDC's data on firearm homicides and find something of your own in that data. If you're smart, you'll also use the extra week to start thinking about stories you'd like to work on for your team assignments and figuring out what kind of data is available for those stories. <!--more-->


## Spreadsheet Homework

**Part 1:** Slate continues to update their list of people killed by guns since the shootings in Newtown, CT just weeks before Christmas 2012. We've downloaded a snapshot of the data, that includes a single report of a gun death from today, September 11, 2013. Download [today's snapshot][3] and use pivot tables and/or spreadsheet formulas to answer the following questions:

1.  What is the most common victim age?
2.  How many people of that age were killed by a firearm?
3.  What's the average age of a US shooting victim since December 2012?
4.  Which state had the highest number of shooting victims?
5.  Which state had the highest number of female shooting victims?

**Part two:** The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control maintains a [database of fatal injuries][5] in the U.S. Search [their database][6] by the following criteria:

*   Manner: Homicide
*   Cause or Mechanism: Firearm
*   *Census Region: United States (default)*
*   *Race: All Races (default)*
*   Sex: Both Sexes (default)
*   Years: 2008-2010
*   *Hispanic Origin: All (default)*
*   *Ouptut: Standard Output (default)*
*   *All Ages (default)*
*   *Use 2000 as the Standard Year (default)*
*   Output Groups: 
    1.  Age
    2.  Race
    3.  Sex
    4.  Year

You'll find a link to "Download Results in a Spreadsheet (CSV) File" at the bottom of the page. Explore the data, find something interesting and tell us what you found. Your findings should be in the form of 1-2 short paragraphs that tell us why your data or finding is relevant today and what you found. Imagine this text as the nut graf of your data story on your findings.

## Install Refine and Filezilla

If you haven't already done so, you should also download and install [Refine][7] and [Filezilla][8] (even if you already have an FTP client that you like).
