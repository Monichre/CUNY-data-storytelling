# Homework Week 2 (Due Sep 18)

You have two assignments: we want you to answer a handful of specific questions using <a href="http://slate-interactives-prod.elasticbeanstalk.com/gun-deaths/getCSV.php">data that Slate published</a> alongside <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2012/12/gun_death_tally_every_american_gun_death_since_newtown_sandy_hook_shooting.html?wpisrc=newsletter_jcr%3Acontent">How Many People Have Been Killed by Guns Since Newtown?</a> and we want you to download the CDC's data on firearm homicides and find something of your own in that data. If you're smart, you'll also use the extra week to start thinking about stories you'd like to work on for your team assignments and figuring out what kind of data is available for those stories.

## Spreadsheet Homework
Part 1: Download Slate's data on firearm deaths since Newtown: <a href="http://slate-interactives-prod.elasticbeanstalk.com/gun-deaths/getCSV.php">http://slate-interactives-prod.elasticbeanstalk.com/gun-deaths/getCSV.php</a> Use pivot tables and/or spreadsheet formulas to answer the following questions:
<ol>
	<li>What is the most common age of the victim?</li>
	<li>How many people of that age were killed by a firearm?</li>
	<li>What's the average age of a shooting victim in this data?</li>
	<li>Which state had the highest number of shooting victims?</li>
	<li>Which state had the highest number of female shooting victims?</li>
</ol>
Please also tell us the date on which you downloaded the data: Slate is updating it every day, unfortunately, so the numbers will change.

Part two: The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control maintains a <a href="http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html">database of fatal injuries</a> in the U.S. Search <a href="http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html">their database</a> by the following criteria:
<ul>
	<li>Manner: Homicide</li>
	<li>Cause or Mechanism: Firearm</li>
	<li>*Census Region: United States (default)*</li>
	<li>*Race: All Races (default)*</li>
	<li>Sex: Both Sexes (default)</li>
	<li>Years: 2008-2010</li>
	<li>*Hispanic Origin: All (default)*</li>
	<li>*Ouptut: Standard Output (default)*</li>
	<li>*All Ages (default)*</li>
	<li>*Use 2000 as the Standard Year (default)*</li>
	<li>Output Groups:
<ol>
	<li>Age</li>
	<li>Race</li>
	<li>Sex</li>
	<li>Year</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
You'll find a link to "Download Results in a Spreadsheet (CSV) File" at the bottom of the page. Explore the data, find something interesting and tell us what you found. Your findings should be in the form of 1-2 short paragraphs that tell us why your data or finding is relevant today and what you found. Imagine this text as the nut graf of your data story on your findings.

## Install Refine and Fetch
If you haven't already done so, you should also download and install <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine">Refine</a> and [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (even if you already have an FTP client that you like).
