# Homework Week 4 (Due Oct 02)
<!-- Map --> 

Briefly (we'll edit this) your homework is as follows:

+ Map the data you brought in [last week](Week_3.md). Check out Amanda's (mapping)[mapping.md] notes if you don't remember where to find KML files and Shapefiles.

+ Give all of your faculty (Amanda, Russell, Nick) *edit* access on your finished map (find that in the "share" settings).

+ Embed your map on the blog in the "Homework Week 4 - Maps" category. Give your embedded map a little context (50 to 100 words) and cite your sources.

+ Pre-pitch -- come to class with at least two good ideas for your first data driven story. Think about the story you want to tell and the data you need to tell it. Is that data available? In what form?

+ Read Illinsky, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/747533358">Designing Data Visualizations</a>, Chapter 4: Choose Appropriate Visual Encodings in Library or as a <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9781449314774/id2940472" target="_blank">free preview online</a>.

+ Extra Credit: <a href="http://bit.ly/nicarmaps">John Keefe, Dave Cole, Matt Stiles talk on maps from NICAR 2013</a>

Email your pre-pitches and the URL of your class blog post to both professors under the subject “Homework Week 4”
