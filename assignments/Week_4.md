# Homework Week 4 (Due Oct 02)
This week you're going to make a map, do some reading and bring a couple of good pre-pitches to class. <!--more-->

<strong>1: Map the data you brought in <a href="http://datadrivenjournalism.fall.2013.journalism.cuny.edu/homework-week-3due-sep-25/" title="Homework Week 3 (Due Sep 25)">last week</a>.</strong> Check out Amanda's <a href="/mapping">mapping</a> notes if you don't remember where to find KML files or Shapefiles. Be sure to give all of your faculty (Amanda, Russell, Nick) <em>edit</em> access on your finished map. Check that the rest of the world will be able to see your map. 

Embed your map on a new HTML page and upload it to <a href="/using-digital-storage">digital storage</a>. Give your map some context in 50 to 100 words. Cite your sources. 

Write for a newsroom: don't say "This map shows," tell us what we're looking for in the map and fill us in on what we need to know to understand it. Check your grammar, and your AP Stylebook.  

<strong>2: Pre-pitch</strong> Send us at least two good ideas for your first data driven story. Think about the story you want to tell and the data you need to tell it. Find out whether that data is available. In what form? Talk to a librarian,
