# Homework Week 5 (Due Oct 09)
 
<!-- Chart it 3 Ways -->
This week you have one solo homework assignment and one assignment to complete as a team. Everyone needs to chart <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-By-Boroug/avir-tzek">NYC graduation rates</a> three ways, and every team needs to send in a complete pitch. <!--more-->

<strong>Chart it 3 Ways: </strong>

Take a look at <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-By-Boroug/avir-tzek">NYC graduation rates</a> and make three different charts using the data. At least one should make a sincere effort to share the data, the other two can be equally sincere or they can be goofy or absurd. As you wish. We recommend Excel, <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">Calc</a> or Google Spreadsheets, but if you want to try your hand at <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>, <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> or <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/">Protovis</a>, by all means feel free to branch out. Send your work to Lisa, Amanda and Russell with the subject "Homework Week 6."

<strong>Team – pitches for your first story. </strong>
A complete pitch should tell us who cares, why we care now, and what pre-reporting you’ve done. You must include...
+ a question or thesis
+ a news hook, or explanation of why this story matters now
+ a description of and link to the data (which means you have to find your data!)
+ the name of one source you have already spoken with or at least three potential expert sources and your plans for reaching them
+ a sketch or wireframe of your planned visualization (you can bring this in on paper)
Pitches must be posted to the class blog, in the "Pitches" category and the "Team Story 1" category.
