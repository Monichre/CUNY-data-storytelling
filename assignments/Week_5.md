# Homework Week 5 (Due Oct 09)
 
<!-- Chart it 3 Ways -->
This week you have one solo homework assignment and one assignment to complete as a team. Everyone needs to chart <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-By-Boroug/avir-tzek">NYC graduation rates</a> three ways, and every team needs to send in a complete pitch.  

**Chart it 3 Ways:**
We've pulled a [csv of citywide graduation rates](graduation_outcomes.csv) from a <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-By-Boroug/avir-tzek">larger dataset</a> available on NYC Open Data. The Department of Education provides a little context for the data:

> Graduation Outcomes - 4 Year Outcome - Cohorts of 2001 through 2006 (Classes of 2005 through 2010) •The New York State calculation method was first adopted for the Cohort of 2001 (Class of 2005). The cohort consists of all students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the Cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in the 2006-2007 school year). Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma or GED. For the most recent cohort, graduation rates as of both June and August (including summer graduates) are reported. 
> •Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. August outcomes are only reported for the most recent cohort. 
> •August outcomes include all June and August graduates. •In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort, but are included in citywide totals. 
> •School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals.

Your homework is to make three different charts using the data. At least one should make a sincere effort to share the data, the other two can be equally sincere or they can be goofy or absurd. As you wish. We recommend Excel, <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">Calc</a> or Google Spreadsheets, but if you want to try your hand at <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>, <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> or <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/">Protovis</a>, by all means feel free to branch out. Send your work to Amanda, Russell and Nick with the subject "Homework Week 5."

**Team – pitches for your first story.**
Post your first pitches to the class blog. Pitches should be published so that your classmates can read them, but you can use the "Member Access" module to ensure that posts are not visible to the larger public. Use the "Story 1" and "Pitch" categories.
> A complete pitch should tell us who cares, why we care now, and what pre-reporting you’ve done. You must include...
> + a question or thesis  
> + a news hook, or explanation of why this story matters now  
> + a description of and link to the data (which means you have to find your data!)  
> + the name of one source you have already spoken with or at least three potential expert sources and your plans for reaching them  
> + a sketch or wireframe of your planned visualization (you can bring this in on paper)
