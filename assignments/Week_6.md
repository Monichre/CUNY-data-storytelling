# Homework Week 6 (Due Oct 16)

This week you're going to integrate multiple graphs into a single cohesive presentation, refine your pitch and read some Tufte. <!--more-->

**Use the [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/tabs/)** to integrate at least three of the visualizations that you made last week into a single presentation that allows a reader to navigate between multiple views. Upload your html file to Digital Storage, and iframe it on the class blog. Include a headline and text that provide context for your work, cite and link to your source, and publish your work in the "jQuery UI" category. 

If your jquery file lives at `http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/somebody/dataviz/jquery_demo.html` your iframe will look like this:

  `&gt;iframe src="http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/somebody/dataviz/jquery_demo.html" width="200" height="200"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;`

Adjust the `height` and `width` values to accomodate your project. Use `Web Developer > Miscellaneous > Display Ruler` to measure your screen if you aren't sure how big your iframe should be. Experiment!

For this assignment, we’re looking at your handling of navigation, usability, and interactivity to integrate multiple visualizations.    
    
Work with your partner(s) to **refine your pitches** and develop storyboards. A storyboard organizes your content conceptually and spatially. When you turn in storyboards, also include a revised pitch. We use wireframe and storyboards interchangeably here. We’re looking for a simple sketch (on paper, in Word, or PowerPoint, Illustrator, or any number of online storyboarding tools) that shows us how you intend to integrate your visualizations, words, and navigation elements. Use simple boxes to tell us where your different elements will be positioned in a design, and how a user will navigate through the content. Scan your sketch and include it with your post.    
    
**Read** selections from Tufte, Quantitative Display of Information, on e-reserve in the Library: pages 91-105, 176-190. Use the password (ij2012) to access the material.
