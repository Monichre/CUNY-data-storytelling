# Homework Week 6 (Due Oct 16)

**TK Note: this assignment will be revised! As of Fall 2013 we're no longer using Hype.**

Solo – integrate the data and visualizations you made previously within a Hype project and iframe it on the class blog. Use at least three different views of the data and provide navigation between those three views. Include a headline and text to provide context to your work. Use the category “Hype Assignment”. For this assignment, we’re looking more at your handling of navigation, usability, and interactivity to integrate multiple visualizations.    
    
Team – refined pitches and storyboards for your first story. A storyboard organizes your content conceptually and spatially. When you turn in storyboards, also include a revised pitch. We use wireframe and storyboards interchangeably here. We’re looking for a simple sketch (on paper, in Word, or PowerPoint, Illustrator, or any number of online storyboarding tools) that shows us how you intend to integrate your visualizations, words, and navigation elements. Use simple boxes to tell us where your different elements will be positioned in a design, and how a user will navigate through the content. Scan your sketch and include it with your post.
