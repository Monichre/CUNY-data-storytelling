# Homework Week 7: Due Oct 23
<!-- Redesign -->

<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Team assignment</strong>: Rough Drafts are due in class on April 4. Review the syllabus for <a href="http://datadrivenjournalism.2013.journalism.cuny.edu/syllabus/" target="_blank">what we are looking for in a rough draft</a>. We'll have an open workshop on April 4 for you to work and for us to provide feedback.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #993366;">Rough Drafts: A rough draft does not have to have the polish of a final project, but it should be close. You should have created the visualizations that you plan to use. Your classmates should be able to evaluate a rough draft on its merits, without a guided tour of forthcoming features. A complete rough draft includes:</span>
<span style="color: #993366;">+ Clean data in spreadsheets, already normalized, sorted, manipulated</span>
<span style="color: #993366;">+ Visualizations of the data with labeled axes</span>
<span style="color: #993366;">+ Captions</span>
<span style="color: #993366;">+ Credits</span>
<span style="color: #993366;">+ A headline</span>
<span style="color: #993366;">+ At least three links to other reporting that puts your story in a broader context.</span>
<span style="color: #993366;">+ Introductory text that includes information gleaned from at least one human source.</span>
<span style="color: #993366;">+ A source list, exactly like the ones you hand in for Craft II.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #993366;">Youâ€™re not required to quote your source, but you do need to be able to tell the class what insights your human source provided.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Solo Design assignment</strong>: Re-design a data visualization. Using ONE of the three infographics below, identify the visualization and/or design weaknesses and sketch your approaches to improve them. Deliverable: sketch on paper, scanned to be submitted and for potential presentation.</p>
