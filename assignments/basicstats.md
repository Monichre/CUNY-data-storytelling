If you can't tell the difference between the mean and the median with 100% assurance, <a href="http://www.robertniles.com/stats/">Robert Niles is your friend</a>. His "<a href="http://www.robertniles.com/stats/">Statistics Every Writer Should Know</a>" is just that. There are plenty of resources to bring your math and statistics up to speed, though: 

+ Really <a href="http://forjournalists.com/cookbook/index.php?title=Math_cribsheet">basic newsroom math</a> (from ASU Cronkite Professor Steve Doig),

+ <a href="http://www.statisticshell.com/html/apf.html">Statistics Hell</a> is bizarre and unnerving, but includes tons of handouts and lessons on statistical methods. If animated gifs of flame engulfed brains aren’t your thing, maybe look elsewhere.

+ <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is a statistical computation language. Take a look at their <a href="http://www.r-project.org/other-docs.html">Documentation</a> and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html">Contributed Documentation</a>

**Classes**

+ <a href="http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/forstudents/freecourses/statistics">open courses at Carnegie Mellon</a>

+ <a href="http://www.pgm-class.org/">Probabilistic Graphical Models</a> (at Stanford)

**Books**

+ <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/213307384">Head First Statistics</a> is supposed to be a good way to get started. There’s a Data Analysis book in the series, too.

+ Windows users might like <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/382399648">R through Excel</a>.

+ Think Stats (<a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/html/index.html">html</a>, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/727703593oclc">bound</a>)

+  <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48822382">Numbers in the Newsroom</a> (which <a href="http://www.ire.org/resource-center/books/">IRE sells</a>) are both supposed to be very good.
