# The Checklist

1. Question the context Do you understand the context this data was collected in? Your captions should reflect that context.  
2. Know your numbers. Did you say “average” when you really mean “median”? Are your numbers normalized so that you’re comparing apples and apples? If you need to combine some columns or drop others, are your choices rational (and not simply convenient?)  
3. Apples to apples. Incidents per 100,000 in two cities or ten years apart are fair to compare. But if you tell readers that there were 11,000 cases of gonorrhea in 2000 and 12,000 in 2010, a reasonable reader will want to know how that compares to the change in population over that decade.   
4. Talk to someone who understands the numbers. It is tempting to take a report at face value, but your reporting isn't complete unless you've actually spoken with at least one source who has some familiarity with the numbers that you're looking at.   
5. Use captions to help the story along. A good caption expands on your visualization without describing it. I could say "this checklist includes the ingredients for a complete data visualization" but you already know you're looking at a checklist. So use the caption to tell us what you see in the data. Add something.  
6. Watch the hyperbole. Be ready to back up every statement of fact. If you introduce a story with a line like "More Americans than ever are buying pants these days" make sure you know that is true. Aways be accurate.  
7. Don't "click here" – If you have to say "click here" your project is missing something. Show it, don't say it.   
8. Link to the raw data. Newsrooms will take different positions on this one, but for class assignments, include a link to both the source of your data (the site you downloaded it from) and the data you used to generate the visualization. If those are one and the same, great. But if you had to clean the data or manipulate it to make your visualization, you need to share that cleaned data with your readers.   
9. Cite your sources. Who did you get the data from, and when? Provenance matters: if the ACLU has compiled a years worth of quarterly NYPD reports and published them as a single free standing data set, did you get the data from NYPD or ACLU?  
10.  Edit for brevity Look for filler text and rewrite it out. Phrases like "here you can see" or "in this chart" or "this graph shows" just fill space. Tell the reader why the numbers are interesting (and do it without saying "these numbers are interesting because ...")  
11. Edit for redundancy Every word counts. If you find that you’re using the same phrase again and again, that’s a sign that you need to rework your text. 

<table><th> <td>Redundant</td><td>Much Better</td></th>
<tr><td>
Total Arrests in 2009: 39    
Total Arrests in 2010: 422    
Total Arrests in 2011: 3       
</td><td>
Total arrests  
2009: 39  
2010: 422  
2011: 3  </td>
</tr></table>

12. Edit for grammar and style. Deviations from AP Style are sometimes acceptable to save space, but know when you're making exceptions. Take one last pass and check your grammar.   
13.  Put your reporting in context with links. You aren’t reporting in a vacuum — highlight the reports and reporting that put your story in context.  


# Guiding Principles
+ Don’t make your readers work. 
If readers have to flip between tabs to make comparisons, or cross reference multiple legends, they're working too hard. The goal of a visualization, at least in the newsroom, should be to make the data easier to understand. Don't make it harder. 
+ Understand visual encoding. Properties like position, length, angle, area, hue, saturation, and brightness convey information by encoding your data, and many of those properties come with cultural expectations. What do  these properties represent in your visualization? If you don't know, you need to. 
+ Focus on the data. Chart junk and decoration get in the way of the data, so avoid them.
