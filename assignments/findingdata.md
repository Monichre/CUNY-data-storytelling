The Journalism School's Research Center maintains <a href="http://researchcenter.journalism.cuny.edu/research-guides/">an excellent roundup</a> of guides, many of which will point you to great data sets. Check out the census, business and crime guides in particular. 

<a href="http://ire.org/nicar/">NICARâ€™s database library</a> is a great resource. So is<a href="http://jour72312.tumblr.com/tagged/data-sources"> our class tumblr's "data sources" tag</a>.<!--more-->

Get into the habit of checking the source credits on data stories when you see them. None of us suggested <a href="http://smartgunlaws.org/">The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a>, <a href="NRA Institute for Legislative Action">NRA Institute for Legislative Action</a> or <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, but the Guardian credited them. 

Here are some of the sources we came up with in class. I didn't look up URLs for all of these groups, but you should be able to find them. This is the tip of the iceberg, though. 

<blockquote>**Local Data**
City and State health departments  
City and State elections boards  
Campaign Finance Board  
Brooklyn College Center for the Study of Brooklyn  
<a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/">NYC Open Data</a>  
<a href="http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/">Independent Budget Office</a>  
NYPD  
State Department of Criminal Justice</blockquote>

<blockquote>**Federal Data**
Centers for Disease Control  
<a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/index.html">TRAC</a> (Immigration Data)  
<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/">Congresional Budget Office</a> 
Arab American Institute  
Dept of Homeland Security  
Census/ ACS  
Open Secrets  
FBI  
ATF  
DOE  
<a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/">Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence</a>  
</blockquote>



<blockquote>**World Data**
World Health Organization  
</blockquote>

Don't forget that it is up to you to know where your sources are coming from. You can roughly guess who is behind NRA Institute for Legislative Action, but what about Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence?
