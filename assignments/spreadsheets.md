## Spreadsheet Basics

We looked at formulas to find the `=AVERAGE()` and `=MEDIAN()` of a range of cells (working with [MLB salary data](http://data.newsday.com/long-island/data/baseball/mlb-salaries-2013/))

We downloaded Google's <a href="http://www.google.org/flutrends/data.txt">data</a> on <a href="http://www.google.org/flutrends/about/how.html">flu related searches</a>. We used `data > text to columns ...` to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214261">break the text block into columns</a>, and then used some <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/overview-of-formulas-HA102748997.aspx?CTT=1">Excel formulas</a> to find `=MAX()` values. 

We didn't use the <a href="https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Applying_AutoFilter">auto filter</a> button to set up filters that let us sort the data by a single column, but we could have. We also didn't use `paste special > transpose` to shift <a href="https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Rotating_Tables_Transposing">rows into columns</a>, but we could have, if we wanted to. 

We used data Matt got from [iCasualties.org](http://icasualties.org/) to play with pivot tables, in [Google Spreadsheets](http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/05/pivot-tables-now-in-google-spreadsheets.html) and Excel.
