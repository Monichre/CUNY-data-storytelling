We didn't talk a lot about version control this semester but a lot of you hit some real walls on this project and it seems like a good moment to show you at least one good tool.<!--more-->

Diff shows the differences between two files. Your mac comes with a command line diff tool, but it is a whole lot easier to use a graphical tool. I use <a href="http://meldmerge.org/">Meld</a> because I'm used to it, but TextWrangler has a "Find Differences..." in its search menu, or there are two perfectly good web based diff tools worth knowing about: 


* [Quickdiff](http://www.quickdiff.com/) is clean and easy.

* [Pretty Diff](http://prettydiff.com) has a whole lot of options, if you like those. 


Someone wrote a <a href="https://github.com/borysf/Sublimerge">diff plugin for Sublime</a> but I've never tried to install plugins on Sublime so I have no idea how hard or easy that might turn out to be.

When you're making a lot of changes to something like a template that works, it helps (a lot) to save and test your work as you go. Make one change -- did it break anything? Make another change.

I also (strongly) encourage you to take a look at Git if you want to keep doing this work. Git is free and open source software. <a href="http://mac.github.com/">Github</a> is a proprietary service that manages repositories, <a href="http://gitorious.org/about">gitorious</a> is a free and open source service. But using Git means periodically "checking in" -- it is a step above saving out working versions.
