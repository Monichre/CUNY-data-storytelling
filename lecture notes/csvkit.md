# CSVkit

## Vanity
Before we do more, go ahead and look under `Terminal > Preferences` and set the default to "Homebrew" -- you can futz with that on your own later if you'd like a different color scheme. 

## Installing
~~`pop install csvkit` is the easiest, but if you don't have admin privileges, you'll need to do use the `--target` flag and make sure the target is in `PYTHONPATH`~~
