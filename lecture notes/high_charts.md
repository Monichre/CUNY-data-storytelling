Check out Scientific American's [12 Graphics That Contain Everything You Need to Know about Climate Change](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2014/01/31/12-graphics-that-contain-everything-you-need-to-know-about-climate-change/) and The Atlantic's story on [how little Americans sleep](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/how-much-do-we-sleep-americans-dont-know/283148/) 

The Atlantic acutally lifted that image from the [Economix blog](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/you-sleep-more-than-you-claim-you-do/), but we can got back to the [time use data](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t03.htm) that they used. (Paste it and use `Text to Columns`)
