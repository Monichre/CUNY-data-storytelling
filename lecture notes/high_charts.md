#High Charts

Check out Scientific American's [12 Graphics That Contain Everything You Need to Know about Climate Change](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2014/01/31/12-graphics-that-contain-everything-you-need-to-know-about-climate-change/) and The Atlantic's story on [how little Americans sleep](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/how-much-do-we-sleep-americans-dont-know/283148/) 

The Atlantic actually lifted that image from the [Economix blog](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/you-sleep-more-than-you-claim-you-do/), but we can got back to the [time use data](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t03.htm) that they used. (Paste it and use `Text to Columns`)

## Gun Deaths Data

What does the rate mean? How would we figure that out?

(1) by age...question: are there more child homicides by firearms now then there were in 1999? compare 1999 age distribution vs. 2010 age distribution.

Pivot by age, totals under 18. 

(2) by race...question:what are the trends from 1999-2010 for overall homicides by race? stacked graph shows proportions; compare that with line graph (not stacked).

We're doing this on pen and paper for a reason: this is where you start. 

The Atlantic has been doing some interesting reporting on copyright and availability of texts. I'm sure we could have a rousing debate about the fundamental thesis here, but my real question is this: how many of you find this graphic to be "shocking"?

> The graph above shows the simplest interpretation of the data. It reveals, 
> shockingly, that there are substantially more new editions available of books from the 1910s than from the 2000s

Here's another tip that didn't make it on the checklist: your job as a journalist, my job, is to decide what is important. So pick one chart. 

The researchers pulled data on 7000 Amazon titles by randomly generating ISBNs and looking up the corresponding books. 
Though the key says "fiction and non-fiction books," the paper is fairly clear:

 > Of the randomly selected new fiction editions for sale on Amazon, the software program
 > located 2317 of the titles40 in the LOC catalog.

So here's your first project: Pick the chart that you think is soundest and rewrite it. 

The first chart is all new editions (as opposed to used books); the second is titles (which they've done some statistical tweaking on -- an average book has 4 editions)

###Instructions
1) What is the point? 
2) Can we arrange it news-style with a headline, subtext, credit? 
3) Could we clean it up to focus on the relevant finding?
