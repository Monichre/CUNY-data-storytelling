Jobs Drill

On May 2, the BLS [will release](http://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/empsit.htm) their April jobs report, and Greg David is lobbying for a multi-class drill that morning. 

The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the December jobs report [January 10, 2014](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) so take a look at how the WSJ ([story](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303848104579312263978373456) /[graphics](http://online.wsj.com/news/interactive/ECONOMYJP0111?ref=SB10001424052702303848104579312263978373456)) and [NYTimes](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/category/jobs-report-2/) covered that report.

We're going to come in at 9:30, pull down the data and do our best charts by noon.
