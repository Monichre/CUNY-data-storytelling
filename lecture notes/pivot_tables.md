#Pivot Tables

Getting Summary Data

Pivots work a bit differently in Google Spreadsheets and Excel so we're going to walk through both. 

Other good pivots -- how many gas wells per county, from DEC’s list of all wells; Count and sum of donations by state, city, zip code (particularly good for a cleaned data set.)

* Matt Surrusco identified this data set, which has lots of pivoty richness.

Some questions:
