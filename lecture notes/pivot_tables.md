#Pivot Tables
Spreadsheets are Handy, but pivot tables are incredibly useful. 

Pivots work a bit differently in Google Spreadsheets and Excel so we're going to walk through both. 

Last semester, Matt Surrusco found [iCasualties.org](http://icasualties.org/OEF/Index.aspx) -- NYT has a nice [profile of Michael White](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/media/22link.html) who trolls through news sites and official releases to build out a database of coalition forces deaths. Start with <http://icasualties.org/OEF/OEF_US_Fatalities.xls> and pivot by year. 

The Department of Environmental Conservation publishes [data on gas wells](http://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/1603.html) in New York State. Download it or it is on GitHub. How many wells are there per county? 

1. Data > Pivot Table Report
2. Add Row

Some questions:
1. What’s the most common age of death
2. How many deaths, and at what age?
3. What’s the most common age of death for members of the CIA? the Army?
4. What rank and branch had the greatest number of casualties?
