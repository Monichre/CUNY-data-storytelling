# Open Refine
Install [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/). If you get an error like "â€¦ is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash," [the solution](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/590) to is not at all intuitive: You have to Change your Privacy and Security settings to allow applications downloaded from "Anywhere" -- it's on the "general" tab. 


Last semester, Matt Surrusco found [iCasualties.org](http://icasualties.org/OEF/Index.aspx) -- NYT has a nice [profile of Michael White](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/media/22link.html) who trolls through news sites and official releases to build out a database of coalition forces deaths. He's not very systematic, however. So we can do some cleanup. 

Note that most pages on iCasualties are paginated, but the [by Nationality](http://icasualties.org/OEF/Nationality.aspx) page is not, or it is possible to [download xls files](http://icasualties.org/OEF/index.aspx) on Feb 13, 2014

For now, grab [my copies](https://github.com/amandabee/cunyjdata/tree/master/lecture%20notes/pivot%20and%20refine) if need be.
