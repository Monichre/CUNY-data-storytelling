#Scrutiny, Skepticism and Ethics 
Scrutiny and  Skepticism Ethics, avoiding distortion, responsible presentation of data

We talked a little bit about the Y-axis last week, some more examples:

And this one:

### Know the limitations of your data:

There’s been lots of good reporting about comstat -- what we really know is that the recorded numbers have gone down. That doesn’t always translate to change on the ground.

**the solution:** always ask how the data was collected. Know it inside and out. 


### Cherry Picking

The Atlantic flagged this WSJ chart, which does a great job of highlighting the narrative they wanted to emphasize. The problem is that if you look at all categories of household spending, you see something different.

Tim Cook made a big announcement in September standing in front of this compelling chart of iphone sales. Look at how steep that is! 

http://jour72312.tumblr.com/post/31361913085 Fox is easy prey, but here’s another case of taking data provided by a (deeply biased) source at face value (or just being a terrible journalist. I’m not sure which). When we talk about unemployment, we have two different figures we can look at: official figures usually exclude “discouraged” workers -- people who aren’t actively looking for work. “real unemployment” is almost always a bleaker figure. 

**The solution:** You’re often going to find yourself working with numbers that were given to you by a source who has a vested interest in how your story turns out. Ask lots of questions. Be skeptical. 

### Don’t over generalize: 
This is a classic in statistics texts: in the 70s, researchers looked at admissions rates at UC Berkeley and found that Women were far, far more likely to be rejected. A closer examination revealed that women were more likely to apply to more competitive programs, so department by department, there wasn’t evidence of discrimination. http://vudlab.com/simpsons/  --

This is closely related to the ecological fallacy: if I tell you that states with more foreign born residents have more wealthy households, what’s your next question? (Are foreign born people more likely to be wealthy? No.) An older study showed that there was a positive state-by-state correlation between literacy and foreign born populations: areas with high immigrant populations were likely to be more literate. What you don’t know is whether *immigrants* are likely to be more literate.

You’re always going to be making decisions about how to organize and summarize numbers, so it is going to be on you to ask yourself whether or not you’re introducing an overgeneralization.
