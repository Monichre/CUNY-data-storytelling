#Tabula Walk Through
Install [Tabula](http://tabula.nerdpower.org/). If you get an error like "Tableau is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash," [the solution](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/590) to is not at all intuitive: You have to Change your Privacy and Security settings to allow applications downloaded from "Anywhere" -- it's on the "general" tab. 

PDFs that have data in them that we can work with:

* [2012 Domestic Violence Reports](http://criminaljustice.state.ny.us/crimnet/ojsa/domesticviolence/nypd_data_web.pdf) Good data, but look at structure (merged cells are a pain to deal with; how should the merged cells be handled?)
* [UNHCR 2010-2012 Asylum Applications](http://www.unhcr.org/507c000e9.html) via UNHCR [Statistics and Operational Data](http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c4d6.html)
* [GLAAD Annual Report](http://www.glaad.org/files/2013NRI.pdf) actually doesn't have tables in it. 

Take a second look:

*  the Mayor’s Management Report <http://www.nyc.gov/html/ops/html/data/mmr.shtml>
*  Department of Health and Mental Hygiene <http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/data/data-publications.shtml>
*  Mayor’s Office of Contract Services <http://www.nyc.gov/html/mocs/html/research/research.shtml>
