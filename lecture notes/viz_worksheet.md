New Worksheet:

For each chart or visualization, fill this out (really):

1. Describe the data's provenance? Who created it? Who did you obtain it from?

2. What is the most important takeaway? What should be apparent to a viewer at a glance? (eg. States that run their own health care exchange have significantly higher enrollment rates). 

3. Are there any secondary takeaways? List those.
